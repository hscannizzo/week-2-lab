    Robert did not pick up on her flirtation. <strong> Or, if he did, he showed it only by stepping back, as though 
    to make her lean toward him, try a little harder.</strong> “Well,” he said. “O.K., then.” He pocketed his 
    change.

But the next week he came into the movie theatre again, and bought another box of Red Vines. 
“You’re getting better at your job,” he told her. “You managed not to insult me this time.”

She shrugged. “I’m up for a promotion, so,” she said.

After the movie, he came back to her. “Concession-stand girl, give me your phone number,” 
he said, and, surprising herself, she did.

From that small exchange about Red Vines, over the next several weeks they built up an elaborate 
scaffolding of jokes via text, riffs that unfolded and shifted so quickly that she sometimes had 
a hard time keeping up. <strong>He was very clever, and she found that she had to work to impress him.</strong> 
Soon she noticed that when she texted him he usually texted her back right away, but if she took 
more than a few hours to respond his next message would always be short and wouldn’t include a 
question, so it was up to her to re-initiate the conversation, which she always did.<strong>A few times, 
she got distracted for a day or so and wondered if the exchange would die out altogether, but then 
she’d think of something funny to tell him or she’d see a picture on the Internet that was relevant 
to their conversation, and they’d start up again.</strong> She still didn’t know much about him, because they 
never talked about anything personal, but when they landed two or three good jokes in a row there was 
a kind of exhilaration to it, as if they were dancing.
