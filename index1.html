    <p>Margot met Robert on a Wednesday night toward the end of her fall semester. <strong>She was working behind the concession stand at the artsy movie theatre downtown when he came in and bought a large popcorn and a box of Red Vines.</strong>

    “That’s an . . . unusual choice,” she said. “I don’t think I’ve ever actually sold a box of Red Vines before.”
    
   <em> Flirting with her customers was a habit she’d picked up back when she worked as a barista, and it helped with tips.</em> She didn’t earn tips at the movie theatre, but the job was boring otherwise, and she did think that Robert was cute. <strong> Not so cute that she would have, say, gone up to him at a party, but cute enough that she could have drummed up an imaginary crush on him if he’d sat across from her during a dull class—<em>though she was pretty sure </em>that he was out of college, in his mid-twenties at least.</strong> He was tall, which she liked, and she could see the edge of a tattoo peeking out from beneath the rolled-up sleeve of his shirt. <em>But he was on the heavy side,<strong> his beard was a little too long,</strong> and his shoulders slumped forward slightly, as though he were protecting something.</em> </p>
