<p>&rarr;<em>Two people sitting just outside of a Starbucks bathroom. The set is arranged as follows: a single elevate platform. Two pillars stand on either end, with a short wall in between the pillars. There's a door in the very back with a toilet sign on it. the lighting is dreamy, lightly colored to start out with. around the platform, a very normal looking Starbucks. ROGER sits with one leg over the wall facing the audience. TRACY stands with her back leaning on the pillar. No one else in this scene should matter. It should feel even as if we, the audience are intruding- this is private, so private we should be embarrassed for even listening in, but hungry to hear all of it.</em>&larr;
